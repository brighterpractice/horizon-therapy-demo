 'A supportive approach to understanding distressing experiences and the patterns, emotions, and body responses connected with them.',
 hero:
 'A thoughtful approach to working with distressing experiences and the ways they may continue to affect daily life.',
 whatItIsTitle: 'A paced approach to understanding the impact of difficult experiences.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Trauma therapy focuses on how distressing or overwhelming experiences may continue to influence thoughts, emotions, relationships, body responses, and patterns of coping.',
 'The work can include building awareness, strengthening a sense of safety, developing practical coping strategies, and exploring difficult experiences at a pace that feels manageable.',
 ],
 sessionTitle: 'Safety, pacing, and trust are part of the process.',
 session: [
 'Sessions may begin with understanding current concerns, identifying existing strengths and supports, and developing tools for managing distress before moving into more difficult material.',
 'The pace and focus of therapy can shift over time depending on current circumstances, readiness, and what feels most helpful.',
 ],
 considerationsTitle: 'Trauma work is individualized.',
 considerations: [
 'Not every client needs to discuss difficult experiences in detail for therapy to be useful.',
 'The pace can be adjusted according to readiness, current stressors, and the goals of counseling.',

 'A framework for noticing different internal parts and protective patterns with curiosity rather than judgment.',
 hero:
 'A framework for understanding different internal reactions, protective patterns, and conflicting feelings with curiosity.',
 whatItIsTitle: 'Different parts of us can respond in different ways.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Internal Family Systems, often called IFS, offers a way to notice different parts of a person’s internal experience. One part may want change while another feels cautious; another may criticize, avoid, please, control, or stay alert in an effort to protect.',
 'Rather than immediately trying to eliminate these reactions, IFS work can help explore what they may be protecting against, what they need, and how they developed.',
 ],
 sessionTitle: 'The work can begin with noticing what is happening now.',
 session: [
 'Morgan may help clients notice thoughts, emotions, physical cues, or internal reactions that seem to pull in different directions and explore what those responses may be trying to accomplish.',
 'The work may involve understanding protective patterns and developing a less adversarial relationship with reactions that have felt frustrating, confusing, or difficult to change.',
 ],
 considerationsTitle: 'IFS is one framework among several.',
 considerations: [
 'Clients do not need to use IFS terminology for the work to be useful.',
 'The approach can be adapted to the individual and the focus of counseling.',
 'Morgan may combine IFS concepts with other approaches when that better fits the client.',

 'An approach that includes physical sensations and nervous-system responses alongside thoughts, emotions, and experiences.',
 whatItIsTitle: 'Emotional experiences can also have a physical dimension.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Stress, emotion, and difficult experiences can show up physically through tension, breathing changes, restlessness, numbness, tightness, changes in energy, or other body sensations.',
 'Morgan may incorporate Somatic Experiencing and other body-informed practices to notice these responses, understand what seems to activate or settle them, and include the body as one source of information during counseling.',
 ],
 sessionTitle: 'Body awareness is introduced gently.',
 session: [
 'When it is useful, Morgan may invite attention to physical sensations, movement, breathing, posture, or changes in the body while discussing an experience.',
 'Clients remain in control of the pace. Attention to body sensations can be brief, adjusted, or set aside when it does not feel useful.',
 ],
 considerationsTitle: 'The body is one source of information.',
 considerations: [
 'Body-informed therapy does not assume that every concern has a physical cause or that every client needs to focus on body sensations.',
 'Body awareness can be combined with conversation, reflection, IFS, mindfulness, or other counseling approaches.',
 'The focus remains on what is useful and appropriate for the individual client.',

 'An approach for understanding emotional responses, attachment needs, and recurring patterns in important relationships.',
 whatItIsTitle: 'Emotions can provide useful information about connection and protection.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Emotionally Focused Therapy, or EFT, pays close attention to emotional experience and patterns involving closeness, safety, conflict, vulnerability, attachment, and connection.',

 whatItIsTitle: 'Mindfulness can create space around an experience.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Mindfulness involves intentionally noticing present-moment experience. In counseling, that may include thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, impulses, breathing, or patterns of attention.',
 'Mindfulness-based work may include developing greater awareness of thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and patterns of reaction without requiring a particular meditation practice.',
 ],
 sessionTitle: 'Mindfulness is adapted to the person.',

 'Mindfulness in counseling does not require sitting silently or trying to empty the mind. It may involve briefly noticing a reaction, observing a body sensation, paying attention to breathing, or slowing down enough to identify what is happening.',

 ],
 considerationsTitle: 'Mindfulness can be used when it supports the work.',

 'Clients do not need prior meditation experience.',
