 whatItIsTitle: 'Different parts of us can respond in different ways.',
 whatItIs: [
 'Internal Family Systems, often called IFS, offers a way to notice different parts of a person’s internal experience. One part may want change while another feels cautious; another may criticize, avoid, please, control, or stay alert in an effort to protect.',
 'Rather than immediately trying to eliminate these reactions, IFS work can help explore what they may be protecting against, what they need, and how they developed.',
