# Deployment

Horizon Therapy is a static Astro site deployed from [horizon-therapy-demo](https://github.com/horizon-therapy-demo) to Cloudflare Pages.

## Cloudflare Pages project

Connect the GitHub repository in **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** and use:

- Production branch: `main`
- Framework preset: Astro
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `dist`
- Root directory: repository root
- Node.js: `22.12.0` or newer, matching `package.json`
- Environment variables: none currently required

Do not add the Cloudflare adapter, Pages Functions, Wrangler, or SSR for the current site. Astro produces the complete static deployment in `dist/`.

## Deployment workflow

Pull requests and non-production branches should receive Cloudflare preview deployments. Review the preview URL before merging. A merge to `main` triggers the production build and deployment.

Cloudflare Pages keeps previous deployments. If a production issue is discovered, select the last known-good production deployment in the Pages dashboard and use **Rollback to this deployment**. Follow with a source fix on `main` so the repository and live deployment remain aligned.

## Custom domain and DNS

Add `horizon-therapy-demo.example` under the Pages project's **Custom domains** settings and follow Cloudflare's DNS prompts. The site configuration, canonical URLs, sitemap, and robots file assume the apex domain:

`https://horizon-therapy-demo.example`

Choose the apex domain as the single canonical host. Configure `www.horizon-therapy-demo.example` to redirect permanently to the apex domain, and confirm Cloudflare's automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect is active. Test the custom domain before announcing launch.

Security and cache response headers live in `public/_headers`. After the first deployment, inspect representative HTML, `/_astro/` assets, images, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` in the browser network panel or with `curl -I` to confirm the rules are active.

## Search Console

1. Add a Google Search Console **Domain property** for `horizon-therapy-demo.example`.
2. Copy the verification TXT value supplied by Google; do not create one manually.
3. Add that TXT record in Cloudflare DNS and complete verification in Search Console.
4. Submit `https://horizon-therapy-demo.example/sitemap.xml`.
5. Inspect the homepage and representative service pages after deployment, then request indexing when appropriate.
6. Confirm the apex-domain redirect, canonical URLs, and indexed host agree.

DNS verification is preferred because it covers the domain and its protocol/subdomain variants without adding a verification tag to the site.

## Future integrations

- Appointment destination: set `appointmentExternalUrl` in `src/data/site.ts`.
- Client Portal destination: set `clientPortalExternalUrl` in `src/data/site.ts`.
- Analytics: retain the existing `data-track` attributes as the event vocabulary. Add a small provider integration in the shared layout only after the provider, privacy configuration, and identifier are confirmed. Never send query strings, user-entered text, or clinical information in event payloads. Update the Content Security Policy in `public/_headers` only for the exact provider origins required.

External appointment and portal links intentionally open in the same tab. If that policy changes, add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` whenever `target="_blank"` is introduced.

## Pre-deployment checks

Run:

```bash
npm run build
git diff --check
```

Confirm the 404 page, legal pages, nine service pages, sitemap, robots file, official branding, Morgan clinician profile, appointment fallback, and Client Portal fallback are present in `dist/`.
